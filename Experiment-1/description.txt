Description of the HTML Code:
This HTML file creates a Student Registration Form. Here's what it includes:
The document uses the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and is set to English (lang="en").
It links to an external CSS file for styling: student_form.css.
The page contains a heading: "Student Registration Form".
Two identical forms are present (likely a duplication by mistake):
Each form includes three input fields:
Name: Text input, allows only letters and spaces.
Email: Email input, with built-in email format validation.
Age: Number input, restricted to values between 1 and 99.
Two buttons:
Register: Submits the form.
Reset: Clears the form fields.
A JavaScript file (script.js) is linked at the end to handle any form logic.
